        <hr>
        <p>I am Australian, and have been working at a university in London for the last six years as Strategic Planning Manager. I am (trying to) learn 
            web development as I am looking to make a career change to Full Stack Developer.</p>
        <p>I enjoy travelling, reading, eating dessert, learning languages, gymming sometimes, and spending time with friends and family.</p>
